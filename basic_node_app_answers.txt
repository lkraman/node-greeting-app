Basic Node App

What is a Node module?

A module is a function or a group of function. They are completely encapsulated, loosely bound, and work similarly to Reactâ€™s components.

What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

Module.exports is what gets returned at the end of the expression. Exports makes references to the module.export.

Why is using exports recommended?

Exports is a convenient way to write less code. Export can be reassigned. However, module.exports cannot.
